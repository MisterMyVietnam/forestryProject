# About me:
# Hello, I am Mister My – Easy Rider (Vietnamese name: My Nguyen Anh) from Da Nang in
# Vietnam. Since 1999, I have been an Easy Rider and showing foreigners the exciting sites of
# Vietnam far away from mass tourism. I live in Da Nang, but I spend a lot of my time on the
# roads across the regions of Vietnam. With me, you can discover Vietnam’s beautiful countryside
# and nature, get to know a lot about Vietnamese people, food, plants, and history – all these on
# the back of the humming machine of a motorbike!
# I love to introduce interested travellers to the Vietnamese culture and show them the best
# spots of the Vietnamese highlands, like hidden waterfalls, hanging bridges, minority villages,
# wild animals, the best local street food and much more.
# To me, the first priority is the customers- you. Their safety, satisfaction and cheers matter to
# me the most.
# If you want to discover the real Vietnam with me, write me an E–Mail
# on anhmydng@gmail.com or add me on Facebook (My Nguyen Anh). I'm looking really forward
# to showing you around! Be a traveller, not a tourist.
